## Hi everyone! âœ¨

I'm working on my senior capstone with Augusta University. I'm hoping to work on something a bit more fun soon (*possibly contributing to one of the many games hosted here on GitHub!)*. Between coding, you can find me working on a myriad of crafts and projects, or just chilling with a good music playlist. **Happy coding!**
